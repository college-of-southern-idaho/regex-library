# Regex Library

This library is a collection of useful Regex strings that can be used for testing or matching strings.  For the purpose of simplicity, the Regex is currently in JavaScript format.  As expressions are created by our team, more will be added to the repository.

## AP Style Date Validator
This validator matches based on the Associated Press Style Guide for dates, while also allowing for 'TBA'  The years allowed for this particular pattern .  Here are some examples of possible matches:

* TBA
* Jan. 1, 2019
* Jan. 1-2, 2019
* Jan. 1, 2019 - Feb 1, 2019

### See the regex folder for the JavaScript files.
